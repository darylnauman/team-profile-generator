## Description
The focus of this homework assignment for the University of Toronto SCS Coding Boot Camp was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Unit tests were written for the code.

## Key Features
- Inquirer package available from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) allows for the command line prompts and user responses to be captured.
- Built in file system module from Node.js is used to create and write to a file, i.e. index.html.
- Jest was used for running unit tests and there is a test for each class (Employee, Manager, Engineer and Intern)
- Classes, subclasses and constructors 
- Bootstrap is used to help create a responsive website that includes the employee cards, styling, etc.
- The HTML file that is created is based on user input from the command line prompts (e.g., the number of employee cards generated and content within each of them)

## Walkthrough Video
